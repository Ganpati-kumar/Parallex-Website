        <h2> Section One  </h2>
        <p>Trees play an especially important role in enhancing our quality of life in the urban environment and this is
        acknowledged in the Governments Sustainable Development Strategy. They screen unsightly structures and activities, give
        privacy and soften the hard lines of buildings. Trees also bring colour and contrasts into the urban environment.
        
        Not only do trees have a visual quality, but they also enhance the environment in less obvious ways.
        
        Trees improve air quality by acting as natural air filters removing dust, smoke and fumes from the atmosphere by
        trapping them on their leaves, branches and trunks. Just 1 hectare of beech woodland can extract 4 tonnes of dust per
        year from the atmosphere.
        
        Trees reduce the 'Greenhouse' effect by removing carbon dioxide from the air and releasing oxygen. Each year a mature
        tree produces enough oxygen for 10 people.
        
        Trees are also an effective sound barrier and can limit noise pollution. Recent research shows that trees also help
        reduce the stress of modern life.
        
        Trees in themselves benefit the environment and the landscape, but they are also an integral part of the ecosystem
        providing benefits to wildlife and biodiversity. Trees, especially older or veteran trees and those in groups or
        woodlands, provide habitats for native ground flora such as bluebells and fauna, particularly bats, red squirrels and
        invertebrates.</p>

        <h2> Section Two </h2>
        <p>Explore Nature programs and school are created with the concept of experiential learning, exploring our curiosity for
        nature and the natural world...
        With a core focus on positive connection with ourselves, positive connection with others, positive connection with
        nature our programs embrace the true concept of nature connection through meaningful experiences and relationship
        focusing on personal growth and well-being.</p>

        <h2> Section Three </h2>
        <p>“When Albert Einstein said ‘Look deep into nature, and then you will understand everything better’, he did not have
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) in mind.”
        
        Yet many of Einstein's ideas were almost purely products of his mind (if also based on previous work). Sure, he wanted
        to confirm them with observations, experiments, etc. However, they began life as largely mathematical ideas, despite
        Einstein’s stress on scientific imagery.
        
        Take the case of Eddington showing that the sun did indeed bend light. When Einstein was informed about this, he didn’t
        seem to be that impressed (at least according to some accounts). In other words, he believed that he knew he was right
        well before any “empirical conformations”.</p>
